# kaggle_house_prices
House prices for Kaggle competition

## Todo
code the order of operations
1. read raw csv train
2. covert int numbers to integers.  any other type numbers?
3. convert ordinal to rank
4. Imput needed for NA values???
5. create one-hot categories
6. scale needed so things compared equally when doing regularization
    a. try 0 to 1, then standardarization.  then and -1 to 1
7. normalize
    a. l2 with norm
    b. l2 without
    c. scaled
6. basic 512 network


Do validation with 20% to see how performs rought
Then train all if works

<!--6. later - maybe add in polynomials for a few of the categories with interactions. but NN should handle. TBD?-->


<!--scaler = preprocessing.StandardScaler().fit(X)-->
<!--scaler.transform(X) -->



<!--scaling?-->
<!--regularization?-->
<!--polynomial features? with interaction_only=True-->
